    <h3>I. GENERAL GUIDANCE</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Inter-operability of reporting framework:</strong> Those listed entities which prepare and disclose sustainability reports (as part of annual report) based on internationally accepted reporting frameworks such as GRI, SASB, TCFD, Integrated Reporting, can cross-reference the disclosures made under such framework to the disclosures sought under the BRSR. Further, in case the data sought in the reporting format is already disclosed in the annual report, the listed entity can provide a cross-reference to the same. Thus, an entity need not disclose the same information twice in the annual report. However, the entity should specifically mention the page number of the annual report or sustainability report where the information sought under the BRSR format is disclosed as part of the report prepared based on internationally accepted reporting framework.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consistency in reporting boundary:</strong> The BRSR seeks disclosure of the reporting boundary i.e. whether the reporting is done for the entity on a stand-alone or consolidated basis (Reference: Question 13, Section A). Listed entities shall ensure consistency in reporting boundary across the report.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Applicability:</strong> Some of the disclosures sought under the BRSR may not be applicable to certain industries, say the service industry. In such cases, the entity can state that such disclosure is not applicable along with reasons for the same.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reporting Period:</strong> The term “reporting period” refers to the financial year for which BRSR is being prepared.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Clarity and conciseness:</strong> The listed entity should endeavour to provide clear, complete and concise responses. The web-links to the relevant document may be provided, if available.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Complaints section:</strong> The information sought on complaints in the format are accompanied with a column of “Remarks” where entities can explain reasons for pending complaints (if any) or can give a brief on the nature of the complaints, wherever required.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gender-related disclosures:</strong> With regard to disclosures relating to gender, the format specifies male and female, however in case the entity has employed persons who have not disclosed gender or belong to any other gender, a separate column of “Other” may be added for such disclosures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Definition of “Principles”:</strong> The term “Principles” refers to the Principles 1 to 9 as laid down in the National Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct (available at the following link: <a href="https://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/NationalGuildeline_15032019.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/pdf/NationalGuildeline_15032019.pdf</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Additional Disclosures:</strong> In addition to the disclosures sought under the format, the entity may disclose any other relevant sustainability related information at appropriate places.
